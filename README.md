# bsky-furry-feed
A BlueSky custom feed generator for furry content !

Planned feeds in order of implementation:
- Furry chronological
- Furry chronological (AD)
- Furry chronological (Art)
- Furry "whats hot"
- Furry "whats hot" (AD)

Detecting "furry":
- Start with list of users
- Eventually sentiment detection/key words to give a "furriness" score
